# Project 11 - Airbnb App

*Ashley Steitz and Jacob Fritz worked on this as partners*

---

## Description

In Project 11, we utilized React to create a cross-platform app that functions like Airbnb and adopts similar features. We used Expo to run our app, and this will be demonstrated in the recording.

We addressed the following functionality:
- The main layout of the app has five tabs.
- The profile tab only has a Login button.
- Clicking the Login button opens an overlay page presenting several login/signup options.
- After entering the email and clicking continue, you will navigate to another overlay page where you can enter your password and either login or create an account.
- Use Firebase authentication for sign-up, login, and logout functionalities.
- The profile page displays the customerâ€™s name, email, profile picture, and registration date.
- The profile page also has a logout button.
- Clicking a title navigates to a page displaying the details of the property with a button to reserve the property.
- Clicking the reserve button saves an entry in the Firebase store.
- The trip tab displays the list of reserved places.

When taken to the main page, we allow our users to navigate between rental reservation types, check their reservations/trips, and view their profile.
