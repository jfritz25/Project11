<span style="font-size: smaller;"><strong> Description </strong> </span>
In Project 11 we utilized React to create a cross-platform app that functions like  AirBnB and adopts similar functions. We utilized Expo to run our app and this will be demonstrated in the recording. 

We Addressed the following Functionality:
- The main layout of the app has five tabs
- The profile tab only has a Log in button.
- Clicking the Log in button opens an overlay page presenting several login/signup options.
- After entering the email and clicking continue, you will navigate to another overlay page where you can enter your password and either login or create an account.
- Use Firebase authentication for sign up, login, and logout functionalities.
- The profile page displays the customerâ€™s name, email, profile picture, and registration date.
- The profile page also has a logout button
- Clicking a title navigates to a page displaying the details of the property with a button to reserve the property.
- Clicking the reserve button saves an entry in the Firebase store.
- The trip tab displays the list of reserved places.

When taken to the main page, we allow for our users to navigate between rental reservation types, check their reservations/trips, and view their profile.

UI Challenges:
- Connecting the link as clickable passing the data in from the JSON file and handling it correctly
- UI was relatively simple so not many errors followed

Backend Challenges:
- Calling the API point
- Data Binding stopped working when we attempted the recycler view
- Working with the format through indexing was more of a learning curve but easy once we got it down
